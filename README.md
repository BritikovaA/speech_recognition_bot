# speech_recognition_bot
Speech-recognition telegram bot
To use this, youâ€™ll need to install libraries for working with Telegram bots and speech recognition.
Run the following command: `!pip install pyTelegramBotAPI SpeechRecognition pydub`. 
After launching the bot, you can either record voice messages directly within the bot or forward voice messages from other chats. In both cases, the bot will recognize the message and return a text version of it.
